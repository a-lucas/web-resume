## Viral Marketing definition

>"It is a virus".

Your first customer catches it - and spreads it around like a mad Covid19 contagious superhero.

No need for advertisement fees, all your new customers makes the work of getting new customers to join their movement - because they identify this as an amazing opportunity - something so different and exceptional that they are willing to risk wasting their best friends time by sharing that invitation to join that super space.

Unlike covid19 commercial and manufaturing design - 

> This design only works in communion with an excellent quality - and a long-term trustworthy relationship with ALL the user's human righs. 

## Viral marketing requirements

- High contagion rate > 100%
- Exceptionaly high product quality 
- Natural Low negative reviews 
- First experience is mind blowing for the user

## Viral marketing costs

The costs are very high.

1. It takes time to find the right mind who will come up with that crazy solution nobody though of.
2. It takes even more time for that genius mind to explore and explain different mistakes - in research toward the path to perfection.
3. It is very costly in time and finances to implement and deploy a quality design in production.

### What to do in order to reduce thoses risk?

He who can design a marketing virus into a product, with the product being designed around the virus - can re-invent any product with a viral component integrated.

Today, computer to mind viruses are deeply implemented around the human pysche, often with the ultimate goal to *convert that human lead*.

Their need for a customer CTA (call to action) pushes all their interactions with the user toward manipulating their perception that they need to push that button to live a better life. 

(fake advertisement - scams) - Those are not using enough ethics to be successfull in having a convertion rate superior to 100%.

***Successfull marketing viruses are Noble:***

They only succeed when the don't manipulate perception - but instead display with honnesty a gamified product  - where gamification is designed for the only purpose of improving the user's experience.

*Example: Facebook design has viral design deep integrated into its datastructure -  based on invitations - a friend is a viral medium to join a community of events, posts, messages and possible love*
